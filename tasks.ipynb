    "Before delving into problem resolution, it’s important to provide some context to better understand the origins of the experiment and why it was conducted. This background will help clarify how to approach the task at hand. The \"**Lady Tasting Tea**\" experiment is a essential example in the field of *statistics* and *hypothesis testing*, introduced by **Ronald A. Fisher** in the 1920s. The experiment was inspired by a claim made during a social gathering at Cambridge, where **Muriel Bristol**, a biologist, confidently stated that she could *distinguish* whether *milk or tea was poured first into a cup of tea*. Fisher, intrigued by her assertion, saw this as an opportunity to design a simple yet robust experiment to test her claim and demonstrate key principles of hypothesis testing **$^2$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Fisher's words in his book The Design of Experiments (1935, p. 13) **$^3$**:\n",
    "> Our experiment consists in mixing eight cups of tea, four in one way and four in the other, and presenting them to the subject for judgment in a random order. The subject has been told in advance of what the test will consist, namely that she will be asked to taste eight cups, that these shall be four of each kind, and that they shall be presented to her in a random order, that is in an order not determined arbitrarily by human choice, but by the actual manipulation of the physical apparatus used in games of chance cards, dice, roulettes, etc., or, more expeditiously, from a published collection of random sampling numbers purporting to give the actual results of such manipulation. Her task is to divide the 8 cups into two sets of 4, agreeing, if possible, with the treatments received."

    "Now that we have a list containing all possible combinations of selecting 6 cups, we can move forward by focusing on the actual selection of cups for the experiment. To do this, we will randomly select 6 cups where milks is added first from a total of 12 using simple random sampling. This step mirrors how, in the real-world experiment, the cups would be chosen without bias. We implement this randomness using `random.sample(labels, k)`, which ensures that each cup has an equal probability of being chosen. This technique is crucial because it maintains the integrity of the experiment by guaranteeing that no prior assumptions or patterns influence the selection of cups. This random selection will be also the key to evaluating the null hypothesis in the later part of the task **$^{18}$** **$^{19}$**.  "

    "We previously generated 924 combinations and now, with the randomly selected sample of cups, we will calculate the overlap between these two sets. This calculation is crucial for evaluating the accuracy of the lady’s guesses by directly comparing the cups she selected to those that are confirmed to have milk added first. By determining the number of selections that align with the correct combinations, we can gain valuable insights into her guessing performance. Understanding this overlap is not only important for assessing her accuracy but also for evaluating the statistical significance of her ability to distinguish between the cups. If the number of correct selections significantly exceeds what would be expected by random chance, we can start to gather evidence supporting her claim of possessing a special skill. Additionally, this analysis will help us identify whether her guessing pattern shows any systematic bias or if it is merely a result of random selection  **$^{20}$**."

Hypothesis testing is a powerful tool that allows researchers and data analysts to make evidence-based conclusions. This section will begin by introducing the Null Hypothesis, a fundamental component in hypothesis testing, which serves as a baseline assumption and is pivotal for interpreting test results **$^{22}$**.

    "> Our examination [...] has therefore led us to a statistical test of significance, by which these results are divided into two classes with opposed interpretations. [...] The two classes of results which are distinguished by our test of significance are, on the one hand, those which show a significant discrepancy from a certain hypothesis; namely, in this case, the hypothesis that the judgments given are in no way influenced by the order in which the ingredients have been added; and on the other hand, results which show no significant discrepancy from this hypothesis. [...] In relation to any experiment, we may speak of this hypothesis as the 'null hypothesis.' It should be noted that the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved in the course of experimentation. Every experiment may be said to exist only to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis. (Fisher, pp. 18-19).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment, the null and alternative hypotheses can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$H_0$**: The lady is guessing; her ability to correctly identify the order of milk and tea is due to random chance. \n",
    "- **$H_1$**: The lady has a special ability to distinguish the order in which the milk and tea were added."

    "With the Null Hypothesis formulated, the next step is to conduct the experiment to determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis. Statistical tests are essential tools for this purpose, as they assess whether the sample data provides enough evidence to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. A test statistic is calculated from the sample data, which quantifies how closely the data aligns with the null hypothesis. If the sample data supports the null hypothesis, we do not reject it; otherwise, we may reject it in favor of an alternative hypothesis. Choosing the appropriate statistical test depends on several factors, including the distribution of the sample data (e.g., whether it follows a normal distribution), sample size, whether the variance is known, and the type of data being analyzed **$^{25}$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical tests are generally categorized into two types: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **one-tailed test**: It looks for evidence in only one direction, testing if something is either greater than or less than a certain value.\n",
    "- **two-tailed test**: It looks for evidence in both directions, checking if something is different from a value in either direction, whether higher or lower **$^{26}$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we specifically apply these concepts to the Lady Tasting Tea experiment. Our primary interest lies in determining whether the lady possesses a genuine skill, meaning her performance exceeds what would be expected from random guessing. Thus, a one-tailed test is more suitable, as we are specifically testing for the likelihood that she performs better than chance, rather than simply differing from chance in either direction. As expressed by Fisher, it is common for researchers to adopt a 5% significance level (also called $\\alpha$) when conducting hypothesis tests. This threshold serves as a criterion for statistical significance and allows experimenters to disregard results that do not meet this benchmark. Fisher noted:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"It is usual and convenient for experimenters to take 5 per cent. as a standard level of significance, in the sense that they are prepared to ignore all results which fail to reach this standard, and, by this means, to eliminate from further discussion the greater part of the fluctuations which chance causes have introduced into their experimental results.\"(Fisher, pp. 15-16)\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting $\\alpha$ at 0.05, we accept that there is a 5% chance of erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. In the case of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment, if the calculated p-value from our statistical test is less than 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the lady's ability to distinguish between the cups is statistically significant and unlikely to have occurred due to random guessing. Conversely, if the p-value is greater than 0.05, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis, implying that her guesses could easily be attributed to chance, thus confirming the baseline assumption that she does not possess any special ability to tell the order of milk and tea **$^{27}$**."

    "Before proceeding with the Python test, it's important to address the question: What is the p-value? The p-value, short for \"probability value,\" is a critical statistic used to evaluate the likelihood that the observed data could have occurred by random chance, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Essentially, it helps us determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis. The calculation of the p-value can differ depending on the statistical test being performed **$^{28}$**."

    "The next step involves determining the appropriate statistical test to apply. The choice of test depends on several factors, including the structure of the data, its distribution, and the types of variables involved. Statistical tests are generally classified into two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parametric Tests: These tests make specific assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution from which the data are drawn. Common assumptions include the normality of the data and homogeneity of variances across groups. Examples of parametric tests include the t-test and ANOVA. These tests are powerful when the assumptions are met, allowing for robust inferences about population parameters.\n",
    "- Non-Parametric Tests: In contrast, non-parametric tests do not require the assumption of a particular population distribution. They are more flexible and can be used with ordinal data, ranked data, or data that do not fulfill the necessary criteria for parametric tests. Examples include the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. These tests are especially useful when dealing with small sample sizes or non-normal data distributions **$^{29}$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lady Tasting Tea experiment is classified as a non-parametric test, as it deals with categorical data and does not rely on specific distributional assumptions. Here, the data aligns with a discrete probability model due to the finite, countable nature of the sample (cups of tea) and the absence of continuous variables. In discrete tests, distributions like the binomial, Poisson, and geometric are typically applied. However, these distributions often assume conditions such as independent trials and sampling with replacement, which do not apply here since cups are sampled without replacement. Each selection, therefore, affects the probability of subsequent choices, creating dependence between trials. This dependency violates the assumptions of the binomial distribution often used in discrete cases and instead calls for the hypergeometric distribution.The hypergeometric distribution models scenarios with dependent trials in a finite population and accurately represents the setup of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment by considering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A finite population with a fixed number of \"successes\" (milk-first cups) and \"failures\" (tea-first cups).\n",
    "- Sampling without replacement, where each draw influences the probability of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the hypergeometric distribution, we can calculate the exact probability of correctly identifying a given number of milk-first cups under the null hypothesis. This approach provides a statistically sound framework for evaluating the lady’s ability, with p-values calculated from actual experimental conditions, enhancing the validity of conclusions drawn from the test **$^{30}$** **$^{31}$**."

    "Now that we have a clear understanding of the statistical test we will implement, we can proceed with the implementation in Python. To calculate the hypergeometric probability, we will utilize the `hypergeom.sf` function from Python's SciPy library. This function computes the survival function, which is defined as $1 - \\text{cumulative distribution function (CDF)}$  for the hypergeometric distribution. We opt for the survival function rather than the CDF because it provides the probability of observing more than a specified number of successes, which is particularly useful for our analysis. The mathematical formula for the hypergeometric survival function is given by:\n",

    "The results are now clear: as the number of correctly chosen cups increases, the p-value decreases. This trend provides increasingly strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Remarkably,  even if she is permitted one mistake, selecting five out of six cups correctly still allows for a rejection of the null hypothesis, further supporting the argument for her exceptional ability. When she selects all six cups correctly, the evidence becomes even more compelling, solidifying the conclusion that her skill is significant and not attributable to random chance."

    "The concept of the **normal distribution** has its roots in the pioneering work of **Abraham de Moivre** (1667–1754), a *prominent statistician of the 18th century* who made significant contributions to probability theory, especially through his analysis of repeated, independent events in gambling, such as coin flips. De Moivre discovered that as the number of trials in these experiments increased, the shape of the binomial distribution of outcomes began to resemble a smooth, symmetric, bell-shaped curve. *This curve*, which later became known as the normal distribution, allowed him to **approximate binomial probabilities with a continuous function**, simplifying the calculation of probabilities for large numbers of events. *In 1733*, de Moivre first published his findings in Latin, introducing what is now recognized as the **central limit theorem**. He later translated this work into English in his book, **The Doctrine of Chances** (1738). De Moivre's insights laid the groundwork for future statisticians like **Pierre-Simon Laplace**, who applied the normal curve to the *analysis of measurement errors*, noting that random fluctuations often followed this bell-shaped pattern. Building on these foundations, **Carl Friedrich Gauss** further developed the normal distribution, especially in his studies of *astronomical data*, where observed measurements tended to cluster around true values with random deviations. *Due to Gauss's substantial contributions*, the normal distribution is also referred to as the **Gaussian distribution** **$^1$**."

    "The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about its mean. This means that it describes the probabilities of a continuous random variable, where values can take on any real number within a given range. The symmetry of the normal distribution indicates that data points close to the mean occur more frequently than those farther away. In this distribution, the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value) are all identical and located at the center, resulting in the characteristic \"bell curve\" shape when graphed. This model describes how the values of a variable are likely to be distributed, making the normal distribution a fundamental concept in statistics. It is especially significant because it accurately represents a wide range of natural phenomena, from biological measurements to social science data. Moreover, it serves as the foundation for many statistical methods and analyses, including hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, due to the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will tend to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two key parameters: \n",
    "- the mean ($\\mu$): It represents the central tendency or average of the distribution, indicating where the highest point of the curve lies\n",
    "- the standard deviation ($\\sigma$): the standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean, with larger values indicating a wider distribution and smaller values indicating a more concentrated distribution **$^2$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of how data is distributed in a normal distribution, we can apply the Empirical Rule, commonly referred to as the 68-95-99.7 rule or the three-sigma rule. This principle is based on the observation that nearly all data points in a normal distribution lie within three standard deviations from the mean. Specifically, the rule indicates that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- approximately $68%$ of the data falls within one standard deviation ($\\pm 1\\sigma$) of the mean,\n",
    "- about $95%$ of the data falls within two standard deviations ($\\pm 2\\sigma$) \n",
    "- and nearly $99.7%$ of the data lies within three standard deviations ($\\pm 3\\sigma$).\n",

    "By using this rule, we can quickly assess the spread and variability of the data, allowing us to make inferences about the likelihood of data points falling within specific ranges **$^3$**.   \n"

    "Having gained a clearer understanding of the normal distribution, we can now proceed to generate some normal values and examine whether they conform to the characteristics of a normal distribution. To achieve this, we will use the `random.normal()` from the NumPy library. According to the NumPy documentation, this function generates samples from a normal  distribution, which is specified by a mean (loc) and a standard deviation (scale). By generating these random values, we can analyze their distribution and assess whether they align with the theoretical properties of a normal distribution, such as symmetry, the bell-shaped curve, and the empirical rule **$^4$**."

    "Let’s begin with a graphical approach, which provides a comprehensive visual assessment of normality and enhances our understanding of data distributions. These techniques can reveal patterns or deviations that may be overlooked in purely numerical analyses. One of the most commonly used graphical methods is the histogram. Histograms are particularly effective because they offer a clear and intuitive representation of the frequency distribution of data. Unlike bar charts, which are primarily used for categorical data, histograms are specifically designed to display the distribution of continuous variables. This allows us to visualize how data points are spread across various intervals, known as \"bins\". The visual representation provided by histograms enables us to discern the overall shape of the distribution, revealing whether it is symmetric, skewed, or exhibits multiple peaks (modes). One of the primary advantages of using histograms is their ability to facilitate a quick visual assessment of normality. By simply observing the shape of the histogram, we can quickly gauge if the data approximates a normal distribution or if there are significant deviations, such as skewness (asymmetry) or kurtosis (peakedness). Moreover, the choice of bin width in a histogram offers flexibility regarding the level of detail displayed. By adjusting the number of bins, we can emphasize different aspects of the distribution. A larger bin width provides a broad overview of the data, while a smaller bin width allows for a more detailed examination of specific value ranges, highlighting nuances that may otherwise go unnoticed. This adaptability makes histograms a powerful tool for assessing normality and understanding the underlying structure of the data **$^7$**.\n",

    "Based on an initial analysis of the histogram, the data appears to follow a normal distribution. This conclusion is supported by the symmetric, bell-shaped curve that is centered around the mean. The symmetry suggests that the values are evenly distributed around the central tendency, with the majority of observations clustered near the mean. "

    "Having generated a set of normally distributed values, we now turn our attention to the Probability Density Function (PDF), a fundamental concept that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value. The PDF serves as another valuable graphical approach for analyzing data distributions. For the normal distribution, the PDF is characterized by its bell-shaped curve, which encapsulates the central tendencies of the data. Mathematically, the PDF of a normal distribution is expressed using the following formula:\n",

This combined graphical representation allows us to assess how closely the observed data aligns with the expected normal distribution. By overlaying the histogram with the PDF, we can easily identify significant deviations, such as skewness, which indicates the asymmetry of the distribution, and kurtosis, which reflects the peakedness of the distribution."

    "Our preliminary visual inspection suggests the data aligns well with a normal distribution. However, to ensure a reliable evaluation, we must support this observation with quantitative methods that extend beyond subjective interpretation. To rigorously assess the assumption of normality, we can apply statistical normality tests designed to determine if a sample likely originates from a normally distributed population, providing an objective perspective to complement our initial visual findings. For continuous data, several common statistical tests are available for normality assessment, including the Shapiro–Wilk test, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and additional metrics such as skewness and kurtosis. These tests quantify the extent to which the data deviates from a normal distribution, offering valuable insights into its characteristics **$^8$**."

    "As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the Shapiro-Wilk test is a statistical procedure designed to assess how closely a sample of data approximates a normal distribution. This test was developed by Samuel Sanford Shapiro and Martin Wilk in 1965 and was first presented in their influential paper titled \"An Analysis of Variance Test for Normality\". They stated:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The main intent of this paper is to introduce a new statistical procedure for testing a complete sample for normality. The test statistic is obtained by dividing the square of an appropriate linear combination of the sample order statistics by the usual symmetric estimate of variance. This ratio is both scale and origin invariant and hence the statistic is appropriate for a test of the composite hypothesis of normality. Testing for distributional assumptions in general and for normality in particular has been a major area of continuing statistical research—both theoretically and practically. A possible cause of such sustained interest is that many statistical procedures have been derived based on particular distributional assumptions—especially that of normality (Shapiro, Wilk, 1965. p.591) **$^9$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, they highlighted the effectiveness of their approach, noting that,\n",
    "\n",
    "> The object of the W test is to provide an index or test statistic to evaluate the supposed normality of a complete sample. The statistic has been shown to be an effective measure of normality even for small samples (n < 20) against a wide spectrum of non-normal alternatives. The W statistic is scale and origin invariant and hence supplies a test of the composite null hypothesis of normality (Shapiro, Wilk, 1965. p.602) **$^9$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When conducting the test with a significance level set at 0.05, a p-value that exceeds this threshold leads us to fail to reject the null hypothesis. This outcome suggests that there is insufficient evidence to assert that the data deviates from a normal distribution, thereby allowing us to reasonably assume that the data adheres to the characteristics of a normal distribution. In contrast, if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the data likely does not follow a normal distribution, which may necessitate the use of different statistical methods for further analysis **$^{10}$**.\n"

This function requires an input array x, which represents the sample data we want to test for normality. Upon execution, `shapiro()` returns two key outputs: the test statistic and the p-value. The test statistic indicates the degree to which the sample deviates from a normal distribution, while the p-value provides the probability of observing the data given that the null hypothesis is true **$^{11}$**. \n"

    "While conducting the Shapiro-Wilk test, we encountered a warning that suggests the p-value produced may not be reliable for sample sizes greater than 5000 observations (N > 5000). This warning highlights an important limitation of the test: as the sample size increases, its sensitivity also rises, potentially compromising the accuracy of the p-value. Consequently, it is essential to interpret the results with caution when dealing with large datasets, as the test may indicate statistical significance even in cases where it may not be practically relevant **$^{11}$**.\n",

    "To gain a clearer understanding of the results and determine whether we can fail to reject the null hypothesis, we need to analyze the statistic value from the Shapiro-Wilk test. Ideally, this statistic should equal 1 **$^{10}$**. In our analysis, we observe that the statistic value is approximately 0.99, indicating a close proximity to 1. Additionally, the p-value is significantly higher than the 0.05 significance level, coming in at 0.95. Therefore, we can conclude that the data does not significantly deviate from a normal distribution, supporting the validity of the null hypothesis."
