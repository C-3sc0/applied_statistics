    "Before delving into problem resolution, it’s important to provide some context to better understand the origins of the experiment and why it was conducted. This background will help clarify how to approach the task at hand. The \"**Lady Tasting Tea**\" experiment is a essential example in the field of *statistics* and *hypothesis testing*, introduced by **Ronald A. Fisher** in the 1920s. The experiment was inspired by a claim made during a social gathering at Cambridge, where **Muriel Bristol**, a biologist, confidently stated that she could *distinguish* whether *milk or tea was poured first into a cup of tea*. Fisher, intrigued by her assertion, saw this as an opportunity to design a simple yet robust experiment to test her claim and demonstrate key principles of hypothesis testing **$^2$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Fisher's words in his book The Design of Experiments (1935, p. 13) **$^3$**:\n",
    "> Our experiment consists in mixing eight cups of tea, four in one way and four in the other, and presenting them to the subject for judgment in a random order. The subject has been told in advance of what the test will consist, namely that she will be asked to taste eight cups, that these shall be four of each kind, and that they shall be presented to her in a random order, that is in an order not determined arbitrarily by human choice, but by the actual manipulation of the physical apparatus used in games of chance cards, dice, roulettes, etc., or, more expeditiously, from a published collection of random sampling numbers purporting to give the actual results of such manipulation. Her task is to divide the 8 cups into two sets of 4, agreeing, if possible, with the treatments received."

    "Now that we have a list containing all possible combinations of selecting 6 cups, we can move forward by focusing on the actual selection of cups for the experiment. To do this, we will randomly select 6 cups where milks is added first from a total of 12 using simple random sampling. This step mirrors how, in the real-world experiment, the cups would be chosen without bias. We implement this randomness using `random.sample(labels, k)`, which ensures that each cup has an equal probability of being chosen. This technique is crucial because it maintains the integrity of the experiment by guaranteeing that no prior assumptions or patterns influence the selection of cups. This random selection will be also the key to evaluating the null hypothesis in the later part of the task **$^{18}$** **$^{19}$**.  "

    "We previously generated 924 combinations and now, with the randomly selected sample of cups, we will calculate the overlap between these two sets. This calculation is crucial for evaluating the accuracy of the lady’s guesses by directly comparing the cups she selected to those that are confirmed to have milk added first. By determining the number of selections that align with the correct combinations, we can gain valuable insights into her guessing performance. Understanding this overlap is not only important for assessing her accuracy but also for evaluating the statistical significance of her ability to distinguish between the cups. If the number of correct selections significantly exceeds what would be expected by random chance, we can start to gather evidence supporting her claim of possessing a special skill. Additionally, this analysis will help us identify whether her guessing pattern shows any systematic bias or if it is merely a result of random selection  **$^{20}$**."

Hypothesis testing is a powerful tool that allows researchers and data analysts to make evidence-based conclusions. This section will begin by introducing the Null Hypothesis, a fundamental component in hypothesis testing, which serves as a baseline assumption and is pivotal for interpreting test results **$^{22}$**.

    "> Our examination [...] has therefore led us to a statistical test of significance, by which these results are divided into two classes with opposed interpretations. [...] The two classes of results which are distinguished by our test of significance are, on the one hand, those which show a significant discrepancy from a certain hypothesis; namely, in this case, the hypothesis that the judgments given are in no way influenced by the order in which the ingredients have been added; and on the other hand, results which show no significant discrepancy from this hypothesis. [...] In relation to any experiment, we may speak of this hypothesis as the 'null hypothesis.' It should be noted that the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved in the course of experimentation. Every experiment may be said to exist only to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis. (Fisher, pp. 18-19).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment, the null and alternative hypotheses can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$H_0$**: The lady is guessing; her ability to correctly identify the order of milk and tea is due to random chance. \n",
    "- **$H_1$**: The lady has a special ability to distinguish the order in which the milk and tea were added."

    "With the Null Hypothesis formulated, the next step is to conduct the experiment to determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis. Statistical tests are essential tools for this purpose, as they assess whether the sample data provides enough evidence to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. A test statistic is calculated from the sample data, which quantifies how closely the data aligns with the null hypothesis. If the sample data supports the null hypothesis, we do not reject it; otherwise, we may reject it in favor of an alternative hypothesis. Choosing the appropriate statistical test depends on several factors, including the distribution of the sample data (e.g., whether it follows a normal distribution), sample size, whether the variance is known, and the type of data being analyzed **$^{25}$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical tests are generally categorized into two types: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **one-tailed test**: It looks for evidence in only one direction, testing if something is either greater than or less than a certain value.\n",
    "- **two-tailed test**: It looks for evidence in both directions, checking if something is different from a value in either direction, whether higher or lower **$^{26}$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we specifically apply these concepts to the Lady Tasting Tea experiment. Our primary interest lies in determining whether the lady possesses a genuine skill, meaning her performance exceeds what would be expected from random guessing. Thus, a one-tailed test is more suitable, as we are specifically testing for the likelihood that she performs better than chance, rather than simply differing from chance in either direction. As expressed by Fisher, it is common for researchers to adopt a 5% significance level (also called $\\alpha$) when conducting hypothesis tests. This threshold serves as a criterion for statistical significance and allows experimenters to disregard results that do not meet this benchmark. Fisher noted:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"It is usual and convenient for experimenters to take 5 per cent. as a standard level of significance, in the sense that they are prepared to ignore all results which fail to reach this standard, and, by this means, to eliminate from further discussion the greater part of the fluctuations which chance causes have introduced into their experimental results.\"(Fisher, pp. 15-16)\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting $\\alpha$ at 0.05, we accept that there is a 5% chance of erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. In the case of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment, if the calculated p-value from our statistical test is less than 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the lady's ability to distinguish between the cups is statistically significant and unlikely to have occurred due to random guessing. Conversely, if the p-value is greater than 0.05, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis, implying that her guesses could easily be attributed to chance, thus confirming the baseline assumption that she does not possess any special ability to tell the order of milk and tea **$^{27}$**."

    "Before proceeding with the Python test, it's important to address the question: What is the p-value? The p-value, short for \"probability value,\" is a critical statistic used to evaluate the likelihood that the observed data could have occurred by random chance, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Essentially, it helps us determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis. The calculation of the p-value can differ depending on the statistical test being performed **$^{28}$**."

    "The next step involves determining the appropriate statistical test to apply. The choice of test depends on several factors, including the structure of the data, its distribution, and the types of variables involved. Statistical tests are generally classified into two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parametric Tests: These tests make specific assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution from which the data are drawn. Common assumptions include the normality of the data and homogeneity of variances across groups. Examples of parametric tests include the t-test and ANOVA. These tests are powerful when the assumptions are met, allowing for robust inferences about population parameters.\n",
    "- Non-Parametric Tests: In contrast, non-parametric tests do not require the assumption of a particular population distribution. They are more flexible and can be used with ordinal data, ranked data, or data that do not fulfill the necessary criteria for parametric tests. Examples include the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. These tests are especially useful when dealing with small sample sizes or non-normal data distributions **$^{29}$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lady Tasting Tea experiment is classified as a non-parametric test, as it deals with categorical data and does not rely on specific distributional assumptions. Here, the data aligns with a discrete probability model due to the finite, countable nature of the sample (cups of tea) and the absence of continuous variables. In discrete tests, distributions like the binomial, Poisson, and geometric are typically applied. However, these distributions often assume conditions such as independent trials and sampling with replacement, which do not apply here since cups are sampled without replacement. Each selection, therefore, affects the probability of subsequent choices, creating dependence between trials. This dependency violates the assumptions of the binomial distribution often used in discrete cases and instead calls for the hypergeometric distribution.The hypergeometric distribution models scenarios with dependent trials in a finite population and accurately represents the setup of the Lady Tasting Tea experiment by considering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A finite population with a fixed number of \"successes\" (milk-first cups) and \"failures\" (tea-first cups).\n",
    "- Sampling without replacement, where each draw influences the probability of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the hypergeometric distribution, we can calculate the exact probability of correctly identifying a given number of milk-first cups under the null hypothesis. This approach provides a statistically sound framework for evaluating the lady’s ability, with p-values calculated from actual experimental conditions, enhancing the validity of conclusions drawn from the test **$^{30}$** **$^{31}$**."

    "Now that we have a clear understanding of the statistical test we will implement, we can proceed with the implementation in Python. To calculate the hypergeometric probability, we will utilize the `hypergeom.sf` function from Python's SciPy library. This function computes the survival function, which is defined as $1 - \\text{cumulative distribution function (CDF)}$  for the hypergeometric distribution. We opt for the survival function rather than the CDF because it provides the probability of observing more than a specified number of successes, which is particularly useful for our analysis. The mathematical formula for the hypergeometric survival function is given by:\n",

    "The results are now clear: as the number of correctly chosen cups increases, the p-value decreases. This trend provides increasingly strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Remarkably,  even if she is permitted one mistake, selecting five out of six cups correctly still allows for a rejection of the null hypothesis, further supporting the argument for her exceptional ability. When she selects all six cups correctly, the evidence becomes even more compelling, solidifying the conclusion that her skill is significant and not attributable to random chance."

    "The concept of the **normal distribution** has its roots in the pioneering work of **Abraham de Moivre** (1667–1754), a *prominent statistician of the 18th century* who made significant contributions to probability theory, especially through his analysis of repeated, independent events in gambling, such as coin flips. De Moivre discovered that as the number of trials in these experiments increased, the shape of the binomial distribution of outcomes began to resemble a smooth, symmetric, bell-shaped curve. *This curve*, which later became known as the normal distribution, allowed him to **approximate binomial probabilities with a continuous function**, simplifying the calculation of probabilities for large numbers of events. *In 1733*, de Moivre first published his findings in Latin, introducing what is now recognized as the **central limit theorem**. He later translated this work into English in his book, **The Doctrine of Chances** (1738). De Moivre's insights laid the groundwork for future statisticians like **Pierre-Simon Laplace**, who applied the normal curve to the *analysis of measurement errors*, noting that random fluctuations often followed this bell-shaped pattern. Building on these foundations, **Carl Friedrich Gauss** further developed the normal distribution, especially in his studies of *astronomical data*, where observed measurements tended to cluster around true values with random deviations. *Due to Gauss's substantial contributions*, the normal distribution is also referred to as the **Gaussian distribution** **$^1$**."

    "The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about its mean. This means that it describes the probabilities of a continuous random variable, where values can take on any real number within a given range. The symmetry of the normal distribution indicates that data points close to the mean occur more frequently than those farther away. In this distribution, the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value) are all identical and located at the center, resulting in the characteristic \"bell curve\" shape when graphed. This model describes how the values of a variable are likely to be distributed, making the normal distribution a fundamental concept in statistics. It is especially significant because it accurately represents a wide range of natural phenomena, from biological measurements to social science data. Moreover, it serves as the foundation for many statistical methods and analyses, including hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, due to the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will tend to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two key parameters: \n",
    "- the mean ($\\mu$): It represents the central tendency or average of the distribution, indicating where the highest point of the curve lies\n",
    "- the standard deviation ($\\sigma$): the standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean, with larger values indicating a wider distribution and smaller values indicating a more concentrated distribution **$^2$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a deeper understanding of how data is distributed in a normal distribution, we can apply the Empirical Rule, commonly referred to as the 68-95-99.7 rule or the three-sigma rule. This principle is based on the observation that nearly all data points in a normal distribution lie within three standard deviations from the mean. Specifically, the rule indicates that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- approximately $68%$ of the data falls within one standard deviation ($\\pm 1\\sigma$) of the mean,\n",
    "- about $95%$ of the data falls within two standard deviations ($\\pm 2\\sigma$) \n",
    "- and nearly $99.7%$ of the data lies within three standard deviations ($\\pm 3\\sigma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this rule, we can quickly assess the spread and variability of the data, allowing us to make inferences about the likelihood of data points falling within specific ranges **$^3$**.   \n"

    "Having gained a clearer understanding of the normal distribution, we can now proceed to generate some normal values and examine whether they conform to the characteristics of a normal distribution. To achieve this, we will use the `random.normal()` from the NumPy library. According to the NumPy documentation, this function generates samples from a normal  distribution, which is specified by a mean (loc) and a standard deviation (scale). By generating these random values, we can analyze their distribution and assess whether they align with the theoretical properties of a normal distribution, such as symmetry, the bell-shaped curve, and the empirical rule **$^4$**."
