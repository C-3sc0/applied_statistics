    "Before delving into problem resolution, it’s important to provide some context to better understand the origins of the experiment and why it was conducted. This background will help clarify how to approach the task at hand. The \"**Lady Tasting Tea**\" experiment is a essential example in the field of *statistics* and *hypothesis testing*, introduced by **Ronald A. Fisher** in the 1920s. The experiment was inspired by a claim made during a social gathering at Cambridge, where **Muriel Bristol**, a biologist, confidently stated that she could *distinguish* whether *milk or tea was poured first into a cup of tea*. Fisher, intrigued by her assertion, saw this as an opportunity to design a simple yet robust experiment to test her claim and demonstrate key principles of hypothesis testing **$^2$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Fisher's words in his book The Design of Experiments (1935, p. 13) **$^3$**:\n",
    "> Our experiment consists in mixing eight cups of tea, four in one way and four in the other, and presenting them to the subject for judgment in a random order. The subject has been told in advance of what the test will consist, namely that she will be asked to taste eight cups, that these shall be four of each kind, and that they shall be presented to her in a random order, that is in an order not determined arbitrarily by human choice, but by the actual manipulation of the physical apparatus used in games of chance cards, dice, roulettes, etc., or, more expeditiously, from a published collection of random sampling numbers purporting to give the actual results of such manipulation. Her task is to divide the 8 cups into two sets of 4, agreeing, if possible, with the treatments received."

For example, suppose you need to choose three letters—A, B, and C—from a set. The arrangements ACB, ABC, or BAC would all be considered the same combination since the order doesn't matter.

    "Now that we have a list containing all possible combinations of selecting 6 cups, we can move forward by focusing on the actual selection of cups for the experiment. To do this, we will randomly select 6 cups where milks is added first from a total of 12 using simple random sampling. This step mirrors how, in the real-world experiment, the cups would be chosen without bias. We implement this randomness using `random.sample(labels, k)`, which ensures that each cup has an equal probability of being chosen. This technique is crucial because it maintains the integrity of the experiment by guaranteeing that no prior assumptions or patterns influence the selection of cups. This random selection will be also the key to evaluating the null hypothesis in the later part of the task **$^{18}$** **$^{19}$**.  "

    "We previously generated 924 combinations and now, with the randomly selected sample of cups, we will calculate the overlap between these two sets. This calculation is crucial for evaluating the accuracy of the lady’s guesses by directly comparing the cups she selected to those that are confirmed to have milk added first. By determining the number of selections that align with the correct combinations, we can gain valuable insights into her guessing performance. Understanding this overlap is not only important for assessing her accuracy but also for evaluating the statistical significance of her ability to distinguish between the cups. If the number of correct selections significantly exceeds what would be expected by random chance, we can start to gather evidence supporting her claim of possessing a special skill. Additionally, this analysis will help us identify whether her guessing pattern shows any systematic bias or if it is merely a result of random selection  **$^{20}$**."
